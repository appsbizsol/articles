This organization would become NetSuite, in 1998.

A software startup called NetSuite has created a cloud-based business management platform that is utilized & by over 32,000 rapidly expanding companies worldwide. This platform comprises several programs that aid firms in managing operations, comprehending how well they are doing, & achieving high cost & efficiency reductions. Early-stage companies are moving right to a scalable solution like NetSuite, working on spreadsheets & other entry-level products, as it has made it possible for businesses to build on a quicker, faster, more efficient, & more affordable platform. It has gained the trust of 29,000 users & is used in 215 countries & dependent territories. Oracle acquired Netsuite in 2016.
